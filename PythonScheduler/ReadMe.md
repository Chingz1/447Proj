# Python Scheduler
> Our product takes in class and room data for the UMBC Campus and assigns classes to rooms based on the classâ€™s professor, subject, and capacity requirements. Our software is programmed in python and includes its own user friendly GUI that allows the user to report errors, generate the schedule, view the generated schedule, provide alternatives, and view statistical information such as room usage. Finally our program outputs the generated schedule into a xlsx file for future use.

-All of our code are written in python, we used the anconda environment to run the code
-The following libaries needs to be installed: xlrd, pandas, tkinter, tabulate
-Run schedule2.py with ClassRoom.xlsx in the arguments
-scheduler_gui.py may cause a traceback error or exceptions
-For scheduler_gui, generate schedule first than you can view schedule.
